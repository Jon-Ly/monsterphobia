# Monsterphobia

This turns all indoor and outdoor enemies (eyeless dog, forest keeper, sand worm, and baboon hawks) into text - sorta like the built-in Arachnaphobia Mode.

It also removes sounds from any monster you want

Not ALL "monsters" are turned into text or have sound settings. Bees and non-lethal enemies like the Manticoil and Locust are not text or removed sound.

## Why this mod?

Cause some people want to participate but the game's creatures are too much. Maybe this will help them get out there and be profitable for the company!

## Installation (manual)

Only you need to install this mod, everyone else on the server doesn't.

- Install BepinEx: https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html
- Download the mod
- Open the zip, then place the monsterphobia.dll file from BepInEx/plugins/monsterphobia.dll & the monsterphobia folder in your Lethal Company/BepInEx/plugins folder
- Launch the game at least once to generate a config file. Find it in Lethal Company/BepInEx/config
- Close the game and edit the config file as you want. All monsters are text and all monster sounds are on by default.

## Troubleshooting
- Make sure the option "Enable monster to text technology" in the config file is set to true, not false

## Known issues

- 3 monsters still have footstep sounds even if their sound is disabled: Forest Giant, Coil Head, Spore Lizard
- Baboon Hawk can still make its random squawk noises
- Forest Giant's text is taller than its original model
- Sandworm text doesn't come out of the ground
